# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to crashes if it encounters an invalid user ID or a database error. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to properly handle these errors using try...catch blocks and sending appropriate error responses to the client.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data based on an ID. However, it lacks error handling. If the ID is invalid or if there's an error during data fetching, the application will crash, resulting in an unexpected 500 error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach to handle errors.  It uses a try...catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the data fetching process.  If an error happens, it sends an appropriate error response (e.g., a 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error) to the client instead of crashing the application.  This provides a more robust and user-friendly experience.
